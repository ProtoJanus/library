# library

## Description

This is a personal library manager, that allows the storage of information about books, including the author name, how many pages are inside the book, and if you have read the book or not. This information is displayed in a table, and within an array of objects. There is a toggle button for if you have read the book or not, and this changes the HTML and the object within the myLibrary array. There is also a delete button, that removes the element from the DOM and also removes the book object from the array. Built using vanilla html css and javascript. linked [here](https://protojanus.github.io/library/).
